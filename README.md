Assignment 1 of the course "Introduction to Human Computer Interaction" at the University of Pennsylvania 

Author: Julius Jung

Remarks:
- As discussed with Prof. Head during office hours, I programmed the calendar page instead of the home page, since the changes to the home page are only marginal. 
- I generated some starter code using copilot and used auto completion as suggested by the assignment instructions. 
- However all the design and content has been produced by myself with one exception:
- I know, we did not have to add any functionality, but I really wanted to try out if my idea works, so I added the functionality that you can click on a section to show further action buttons. The Java Script behind the button logic has been designed by Copilot and not by me, but since it was not part of the assignment anyway, to add functionality, I hope that is okay. Also the design of the buttons that pop up was again entirely designed by me.
